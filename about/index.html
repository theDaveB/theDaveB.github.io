	<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
	<p>Been working in IT since 1986 (the year I left high school), this was before the internet and even before Windows!</p>
	<p>I started with dBase II, then moved onto dBase III, FoxBase, FoxBase+ and then FoxPro. Around this time Windows was starting to become popular and FoxPro for Windows was released.</p>
